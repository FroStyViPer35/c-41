**Object Oriented Programming Concept**
*class*- Class is a blueprint for objects in which properties and functions are explained for that object. You write properties in the constructor. 
*object*- object is a real world enitity. Object is an instance of class. 
*abstraction* - Hiding of data
*Inheritance* - Parent class/ Baseclass derives one class from another class. Key word - Extends  Keyword: Super used for - deriving the  properties for the parent class constructor to the child class constructor

**Data Types**
-strings
-numbers
-boolean
-undefined
-null

**Array**
An array is used to store multiple datatypes under a single variable. 
For accessing things inside an array you use the index. The array index starts with 0. push() adds elements to the end of the array and pop() takes away element from the end of the array

**Conditional Programing**
if(){

}

else(){

}

switch(condition){
case 1: action 
break
case 2 :
break
case 3:
break
defold: 
break

}

**Loops**
for (initialization expression: conditional expression: increment expression){

}

**Functions** 
*bounceOff()*  - Both objects will collide and bounce in opposite directions
*tint()* - Tint is used for the visablity. 0- 255 0 = black. 255 = white
*translate()* - Is used to move things to the right
*push()* - Start the function and rever back to push 
*pop()* - Used to end the function
To obtain circle - ellipse(x, y , radiusX, radiusY)

**Database**
.ref - used to refer to the database
.on - listener ( used to see changes in the program)
.set - change value in the database
.val - keeps the value fron the database
